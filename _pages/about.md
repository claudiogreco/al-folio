I am a 4th year Ph.D student in Cognitive and Brain Sciences at the <a href="https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en">Center for Mind/Brain Sciences</a> (<a href="https://www.unitn.it/en">University of Trento</a>) working in the <a href="https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en/257/language-and-vision-lavi">Language and Vision Research Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/">Raffaella Bernardi</a>. Before enrolling in my Ph.D program, I obtained B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.uniba.it/english-version">University of Bari</a>, where I worked on social network analysis and (conversational) recommender systems, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
My work lies at the intersection between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science">Cognitive Science</a>. My research focuses on training deep neural networks from several modalities such as language and vision. I am especially interested in understanding how grounded conversational agents can learn new tasks as quickly as possible reusing the previously-learned skills without forgetting them.
